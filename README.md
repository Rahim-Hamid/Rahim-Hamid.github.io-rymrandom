This site uses a Kaggle database to display random albums from rateyourmusic.com's 2021 Top 5,000 albums using different parameters. Now optimized for all devices

Notes:

1) Due to the hosting service, the site may take a minute or so to work properly if being accessed after a while. 
2) The Listen on Spotify feature assumes that there exists an album on Spotify and so may result in imprecise searches
3) A few of the albums may not properly display their album covers. This problem seems most common with non-English albums, likely due to translation issues.
4) The database is limited due to the restrictions around scraping rateyourmusic.com. I have requested access to their database and may update this site if given permission.
